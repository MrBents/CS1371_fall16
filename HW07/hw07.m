%==========================================================================
%% PART 1.  ABC Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Part of this homework is an m-file called "ABCs_iteration.m".
% Open this file in MATLAB and complete it
% according to the directions contained within. You can test your answers with
% the test file listed below.
%
% Files to Complete: 
%	ABCs_iteration.m

%
% ABCs File Testing:
%	ABCs_hw07_pretest.p
%
%==========================================================================
%% PART 2. Drill Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Included with this homework is a file entitled "HW07_DrillProblems.pdf",
% containing instructions for 5 drill problems that cover the
% following topic:
%
%	Iteration
%
% Follow the directions carefully to write code to complete the drill
% problems as described. Make sure file names as well as function headers
% are written exactly as described in the problem text. If your function
% headers are not written as specified, you will recieve an automatic
% zero for that problem.
%
%==========================================================================
%% PART 3. Testing Your Code
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% You may use the following test cases for each problem to test your code.
% The function call with the test-inputs is shown in the first line of each
% test case, and the correct outputs are displayed in subsequent lines.
%
%% Function Name: primeFinder
%
% Test Cases:
% [out1] = primeFinder(1)
% 	out1 => 0

% 
% [out3] = primeFinder(17)
% 	out3 => 1
% 
% [out4] = primeFinder(18)
% 	out4 => 0
%

%% Function Name: secretMessage
%
% Test Cases:
% message1 = secretMessage('Ite(rat)ion i(s) the most (c)r(a)zy thi(n)g we''ve (learn)ed (to) u(s)e (in) this class, so (g)ood!')
% 	message1 => ratscanlearntosing
