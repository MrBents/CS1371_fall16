Ice Recipe Review


This recipe is horrible! Maybe I should have left them in longer than two
minutes (the recipe doesn't say how long to leave them in the freezer so I
just kind of guessed) but mine came out all watery. I won't be making these
again.

I harvest my own free-range water, so the idea of putting it in a plastic 
tray and a commercially made electricity-wasting freezer disgusts me. I
prefer nature's method, waiting until the temperature outside drops below
freezing.

I was wondering if you had a crock-pot version for this recipe. I work long
hours and I just don't have the time to invest in this kind of hands-on 
cooking, but they really look yummy.
