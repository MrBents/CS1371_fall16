%==========================================================================
%% PART 1.  ABC Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Part of this homework is an m-file called "ABCs_lowLevelFileIO.m".
% Open this file in MATLAB and complete it
% according to the directions contained within. You can test your answers with
% the test file listed below.
%
% Files to Complete: 
%	ABCs_lowLevelFileIO.m

%
% ABCs File Testing:
%	ABCs_hw08_pretest.p
%
%==========================================================================
%% PART 2. Drill Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Included with this homework is a file entitled "HW08_DrillProblems.pdf",
% containing instructions for 6 drill problems that cover the
% following topic:
%
%	Low Level File I/O
%
% Follow the directions carefully to write code to complete the drill
% problems as described. Make sure file names as well as function headers
% are written exactly as described in the problem text. If your function
% headers are not written as specified, you will recieve an automatic
% zero for that problem.
%
%==========================================================================
%% PART 3. Testing Your Code
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% You may use the following test cases for each problem to test your code.
% The function call with the test-inputs is shown in the first line of each
% test case, and the correct outputs are displayed in subsequent lines.
%
%% Function Name: banFinder
%
% Test Cases:
% banFinder('candy.txt', 'floor')
% 		Output text file(s) should be identical to that produced by the solution file
% 
% banFinder('marbles.txt', 'ceil')
% 		Output text file(s) should be identical to that produced by the solution file
% 
% banFinder('tooManyFinds.txt', 'find')
% 		Output text file(s) should be identical to that produced by the solution file
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Function Name: roommateMatch
%
% Test Cases:
% match1 = roommateMatch('BH.txt', 'CS.txt')
% 	match1 => Bob Henderson and Cindy Silverman have a 32% roommate compatibility score.
% 
% match2 = roommateMatch('BH.txt', 'JB.txt')
% 	match2 => Bob Henderson and Jeremy Bones have a 70% roommate compatibility score.
% 
% match3 = roommateMatch('CS.txt', 'JB.txt')
% 	match3 => Cindy Silverman and Jeremy Bones have a 32% roommate compatibility score.
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Function Name: leaderboard
%
% Test Cases:
% rank1 = leaderboard('scoreboard1.txt', 'snakeMaster', 40)
% 	rank1 => Your rank is 1.
% 		Output text file(s) should be identical to that produced by the solution file
% 
% rank2 = leaderboard('scoreboard2.txt', 'thePunisher', 55)
% 	rank2 => You beat your own highscore! You are tied with 1 other player(s) for a rank of 3.
% 		Output text file(s) should be identical to that produced by the solution file
% 
% rank3 = leaderboard('scoreboard3.txt', 'otis', 8)
% 	rank3 => You did worse than last time! Your rank is 8.
% 		Output text file(s) should be identical to that produced by the solution file
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Function Name: chooseAdventure
%
% Test Cases:
% chooseAdventure('giveAMouseACookie.txt')
% 		Output text file(s) should be identical to that produced by the solution file
% 
% chooseAdventure('rudolph.txt')
% 		Output text file(s) should be identical to that produced by the solution file
% 
% chooseAdventure('georgePBurdell.txt')
% 		Output text file(s) should be identical to that produced by the solution file
%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Function Name: reviewReviewer
%
