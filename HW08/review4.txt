Glitter Review

So I wake up in the middle of the night in my 2 bedroom apartment. I find my roommate passed out face down on the
wooden floor. I think nothing of it and go back to sleep. The next morning I wake up to go to work and there is a
homeless guy asleep on my couch. My roommate woke up and had made friends with a bum. And this is the second time
he let a stranger off the street just stroll in and pass out. Great.
You are probably thinking what does this have to do with my arts and crafting.
Well I bought this product and proceeded to cover everything my roommate owns in glitter. Every T shirt, every
book, every pair of shoes, his bed... I covered his entire life in glitter. He will have glitter in every crevice
of his existence until he dies.
Did some track out all over my apartment? yes.
Does the carpet look like a care bear farted all over it? Yes.
Did he threaten to kill me? Sure.
But will he ever let another stranger sleep on the couch? No
Will I ever have to worry about a random guy off the street murdering me in the night? No
All that security for just $12.44. Unbelievable Staggering Value. Cannot recommend enough.
