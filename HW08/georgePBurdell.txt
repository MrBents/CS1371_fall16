George P. Burdell was created by William Edgar "Ed" Smith, BS in 
Ceramic Engineering, 1927. Smith conceived the idea for Burdell when he 
received two Georgia Tech enrollment forms. In a 1977 Atlanta 
newspaper interview, Smith said that he originally intended to enroll his 
Academy of Richmond County principal, George P. Butler, but instead 
changed the last name to <rudolph.txt|9|14> 
Burdell, the maiden name of his best friend's mother.

After enrolling him, Smith signed Burdell up for all the same classes he 
had. Smith would do all schoolwork twice, changing it slightly to avoid 
professors catching his sham. When he had a test, he would take it twice 
and then turn it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded 
Burdell a bachelor's degree, and a few years later awarded the fictitious 
student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, 
even though his name has remained on the active student rolls. In 
1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest secret society, offered 
Burdell membership.

An early prank using Burdell's name came after someone was snubbed 
by a fraternity he had intended to join. "That irritated [him]. He ordered a 
truckload of furniture to be delivered C.O.D. to that fraternity. Of course, 
the order was made by <rudo
