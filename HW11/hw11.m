%==========================================================================
%% PART 1.  ABC Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Part of this homework are m-files called "ABCs_plotting.m" and "ABCs_numericalMethods.m".
% Open these files in MATLAB and complete them
% according to the directions contained within. You can test your answers with
% the test file listed below.
%
% Files to Complete: 
%	ABCs_plotting.m
%	ABCs_numericalMethods.m
%
% ABCs File Testing:
%	ABCs_hw11_pretest.p
%
%==========================================================================
%% PART 2. Drill Problems
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Included with this homework is a file entitled "HW11_DrillProblems.pdf",
% containing instructions for 5 drill problems that cover the
% following topics:
%
%	Plotting
%	Numerical Methods
%
% Follow the directions carefully to write code to complete the drill
% problems as described. Make sure file names as well as function headers
% are written exactly as described in the problem text. If your function
% headers are not written as specified, you will recieve an automatic
% zero for that problem.
%
%==========================================================================
%% PART 3. Testing Your Code
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% You may use the following test cases for each problem to test your code.
% The function call with the test-inputs is shown in the first line of each
% test case, and the correct outputs are displayed in subsequent lines.
%
